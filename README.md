# 🌈 VibeCode — Calm Coding for Neurodivergent Minds

**VibeCode** is a gentle, beginner-friendly coding app designed for kids and teens—especially those with autism, ADHD, or anxiety—who want to learn programming in a calm and supportive space.

We believe coding should feel like a safe hug, not a scary challenge. 💙

## 🎯 Who It's For

- Students who feel overwhelmed by traditional coding tools
- Neurodivergent learners (autism, ADHD, anxiety)
- Creative kids who need a calming space to explore code
- Beginners who want guidance, not pressure

## 🧸 Why It Matters

Many coding apps are loud, cluttered, or confusing—making it hard for neurodivergent learners to stay focused or feel safe.

VibeCode helps by offering:
- Calm colors & low-stimulation design 🎨
- Focus music or ambient sounds 🎵
- A friendly virtual guide (like a buddy!) 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑
- Soft, helpful error messages 🫶
- Step-by-step learning with encouragement 💡

- ⏳ Mood music (rain, lo-fi, ocean)
- ⏳ Friendly guide avatar (Zumi or Koda!)
- ⏳ Error messages that help—not scare!

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project is built by Amaka (11-year-old founder ✨)  
with help from friends—including one who has autism and inspires the whole idea.

We’re building slowly, kindly, and with love. 💛

## 📌 How to Run (Coming Soon)

This will be a browser-based project. No install needed.  
Just open the HTML file and vibe while you code.
